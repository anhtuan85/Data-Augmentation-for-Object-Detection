Data Augmentation For Object Detection using Pytorch and PIL (image from VOC dataset)

* [x] Adjust Contrast
* [x] Adjust Brightness
* [x] Adjust saturation
* [x] Lighting Noise
* [x] Flip
* [x] Rotate
* [x] Random crop

I wrote a repo: [Implementation of Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD)](https://github.com/anhtuan85/Pytorch-SSD-from-scratch) using some data augmentation strategies. Check it out!
